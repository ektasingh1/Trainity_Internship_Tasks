## Project Description:
The hiring process is a crucial function of any company, and understanding trends such as the number of rejections, interviews, job types, and
vacancies can provide valuable insights for the hiring department.  
These insights are then used by the hiring team to know how many candidates are hired/rejected from the process and how many are working in various departments across the company.

## Data Analytics Tasks:
After downloading the dataset, use Excel to answer the below questions:  
A. Hiring Analysis: The hiring process involves bringing new individuals into the organization for various roles.  

Your Task: Determine the gender distribution of hires. How many males and females have been hired by the company?  

B. Salary Analysis: The average salary is calculated by adding up the salaries of a group of employees and then dividing the total by the
number of employees.  

Your Task: What is the average salary offered by this company? Use Excel functions to calculate this.    

C. Salary Distribution: Class intervals represent ranges of values, in this case, salary ranges. The class interval is the difference 
between the upper and lower limits of a class.  

Your Task: Create class intervals for the salaries in the company. This will help you understand the salary distribution.  

D. Departmental Analysis: Visualizing data through charts and plots is a crucial part of data analysis.  

Your Task: Use a pie chart, bar graph, or any other suitable visualization to show the proportion of people working in different departments.  

E. Position Tier Analysis: Different positions within a company often have different tiers or levels.  

Your Task: Use a chart or graph to represent the different position tiers within the company. This will help you understand the distribution of positions across different tiers.
